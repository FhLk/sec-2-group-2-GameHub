## Rule :bookmark:
1.There are 12 single numbered cards, and each card has only one number (1-12).

2.Add the numbers on the cards you get to get as close to 21 as possible, whoever is closest wins. The conditions for losing and winning are as follows:

  -If player has value > Bot player wins.

  -If the player has < value, the bot player loses.

  -If player always = Bot

  -If the value of both sides > 21, it is always considered.

3.In 1 Game, there will be n Rounds and in 1 Round there will be a maximum of 8 Turns (depending on the player's decision).

  - In 1 Round
    
    -Win = 1 point
        
     -Lose and Draw = 0 points
     
     
## How to play :video_game:
1.Players must add the values of the cards they get together to equal or close to 21 as much as possible.

2.You can choose Draw to draw more cards or Stay to not draw cards.

3.If any player is equal to or closest to 21 will be the winner.

4.In the event that any side has a value greater than 21, the right to win immediately.

5.But if both pair is greater than 21, it is considered a draw.
